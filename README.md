Setting up development environment for `notion-knowledge-graph`:
- Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create the virtual Python environment for development & testing (if not already created)
- Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment via the CLI
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python dependencies (if not already installed)
- (Optional): Run `deactivate` to disable venv after finishing development
